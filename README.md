Framework for test-driving libvips optimisations done by John Cupitt (https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips) to scanning frame pixel extractions.

See the examples-folder for how to use the library, or the source for how to use Vips to enable deep learning for image segmentation and classification with a low memory footprint, on terra-pixel sized images.

**Disclaimer:** The segmentation class is currently stale due to changes in the tf api (v1-v2), and will be updated shortly. The segmentation works as before. Hardware accelleration recommended.
